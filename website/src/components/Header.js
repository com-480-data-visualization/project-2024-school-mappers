        Welcome to our data visualization project where we explore educational
        diversity across five countries: USA, Mexico, Switzerland, India, and
        Japan. This project combines macro-level statistics with micro-level
        insights to provide a comprehensive understanding of education in
        different regions. We have selected a range of schools from each country
        to highlight the varied educational environments and experiences.
      </p>

        Our project is divided into three main sections: a detailed view of each
        school, a comparison of schools across countries, and a comparison of
        specific features of schools. You can navigate through the project by
        clicking on elements in the cards and images.
